        <h1>Trees</h1>
        <p> Trees are the green cover of the planet.<br> Trees need water, sunshine and air to grow. <br>The process of photosynthesis that occurs in trees, which helps them grow, uses oxygen and gives out carbon dioxide. <br>Thus, they contribute to the oxygen in the air that we need to breathe to live. <br>They also use up the carbon dioxide that is present in the air and thus prevent the accumulation of greenhouse gas that adds to global warming and climate change.</p>
